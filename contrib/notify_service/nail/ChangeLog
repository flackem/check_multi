[12.5] as of 7/5/10
* The undocumented contenttype-cntrl option works again (patch by
  Laurent Parenteau).

[12.5] as of 6/20/10
* Fixed a message corruption that occurred when the "inc" command was used
  with a mbox format mailbox after encrypted messages had been viewed
  (reported by Martin Neitzel).
* Fixed a condition that caused mailx to hang when looking at a message,
  copying that message, and issuing a "z" command evaluating an uncached
  portion of an IMAP folder.
* Make it compile with OpenSSL 1.0.0-beta2 (patch by Bernhard Rosenkränzer).
* When executing an "account" command, ensure that the values of the "hold",
  "keepsave", "append", and "emptybox" variables remain those of the previous
  account for all outstanding operations on that account (bug reported by
  Jeff Woodall).
* Support Gmail IMAP semantics of "delete" turning into "archive". Previously,
  when mailx was setting the "\Deleted" flag on a message, it did not set any
  other flags. This caused mails that had been read and then deleted to appear
  as unread in Gmail's "All Mail". Now, flags besides "\Deleted" are also set,
  so that they are kept in the archived copy (reported by Jeremy O'Brien).
* For RFC 2047 MIME "encoded-word" parts in headers, assume that the end of
  each word resets the conversion state (Yedidyah Bar-David).
* When the ORGANIZATION variable has an empty value, do not generate an
  "Organization:" header field. Previously, this condition resulted in
  mailx refusing to send mail (Thomas E. Kammeyer).
* When classifying messages with the junk filter, when selecting the most
  representative tokens, prefer non-junk tokens over junk tokens if both
  have the same (reversed) probability, in order to avoid false positives.
* When calculating the probabilities of tokens that have occurred only in
  good messages or only in junk messages so far, and these tokens occurred
  less than ten times, give them slightly less than the minimum/maximum.
* Fixed "unignore" and similar commands; they did not work at all so far
  (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=146280).

[12.4] released 7/29/08
* With the "-E" command line option or if the "skipemptybody" variable is
  set, outgoing messages that contain no text in their first or only part
  are not sent but silently discarded (contributed by Eygene Ryabinkin).
* Support for SMTP AUTH PLAIN has been added (contributed by Joe Feise).
  Set "smtp-auth=plain" to use it.
* When the text of an outgoing message contains illegal byte sequences
  in non-interactive mode, do not refuse sending it but send it with
  the "application/octet-stream" content type instead (thanks for the
  report and further help to Hilko Bengen).
* When an attachment that would have a "text/something" content type
  contains illegal byte sequences, it is now reliably sent out with the
  "application/octet-stream" content type instead (bugreport by
  Hilko Bengen).
* The values of the "sendcharsets" variable are now separately traversed
  for each part of a multipart message, so that if e.g. the main body can
  be represented in ISO-8859-1 but an attachment text needs UTF-8, these
  two encodings will be chosen, respectively.
* Fixed a bug that caused messages to be truncated with IMAP servers that
  use LF as line ending in message data, such as Google Mail (reported by 
  Matthew L. Shobe).
* Do not run filename expansion for IMAP or POP3 mailboxes names, making
  it possible to select mailboxes that contain both brackets and spaces
  in their names (reported by Matthew L. Shobe).
* Fixed the format of the timezone in "Date" header fields for zones in
  the Western Hemisphere whose offsets are not an integral number of hours
  (patch by Matthew Fischer).
* Print an error message when an attempt is made to S/MIME sign a
  message but no "from" address can be determined (Georgi Stanojevski).
* Made the getopt() substitute work with the getopt$UNIX2003() function
  redirection mechanism on Mac OS X Leopard.
* Fixed an incorrect type of enum (patch by Matthew Fischer).

[12.3] released 7/15/07
* Multibyte characters are now handled correctly when printing texts
  encoded in base64. Previously, if a multibyte character spanned
  across a line in the base64-encoded representation, it was not
  recognized, and substitution characters were printed instead.
* In an SMTP exchange, ignore if the server closes the connection
  following the QUIT command instead of sending a proper response code,
  fixing a problem with GMail (Dr. Gary E. Rafe).
* A null pointer dereference that lead to a segmentation fault when
  the user hit return at a yes/no question has been fixed (patch by
  Martin Neitzel).
* If no proper boundary is present in a MIME multipart message, print
  a notification message since otherwise no content is shown at all
  (problem reported by Thomas Wolff).
* When both standard input and standard output refer to a terminal,
  ignore SIGPIPE since there is no reason why it should ever terminate
  mailx then. This fixes problems with mailx terminating when reading
  a message and ^C is typed in the pager under some circumstances
  (analysis by Stephen Isard and Perry Hutchison).
* Build without socket support again (patch by Andreas Niederl).
* Fixed a single quote in "makeconfig" that could cause a problem with
  the C preprocessor (patch by Martin Neitzel).
* Building with recent versions of Mozilla NSS is now possible.

[12.2] released 1/7/07
* When a MIME message part is not of the "text/" content type, always
  send it in base64 to avoid issues with CRLF conversion (David Ronis).
* Character set conversion is now also applied to attachments if they
  have the "text/" content type. This is necessary because with the
  "sendcharsets" variable, the character set declaration that becomes
  effective in the message part is otherwise unpredictable.
* Character set conversion is now only applied to message parts that
  have the "text/" content type. Previously, a message part that did
  not contain any control characters but was not of type "text/" was
  converted.
* When message file names in a maildir folder do not contain the ":2,"
  preceding the flags part, append one (Brandon Andrews).
* An invalid memory access when determining the current message in
  threaded mode has been fixed (MJ Ray).
* A "STRIP" makefile variable has been introduced to control the strip
  command at "make install".
* The "remove" command no longer causes a core dump because of a null
  pointer dereference when it is given a name with invalid shell syntax.
* Made it compile on UnixWare again (patch by Joe Julian).
* Fixes to build with more recent versions of Mozilla NSS.

[12.1] released 6/15/06
* The base64 encoder also used an invalid encoding for the last unit of
  data if (bytes_of_input % 3 == 1). As with the previous similar bug,
  most base64 decoders, including mailx's own, ignore such bits since
  base64 data is always a multiple of 8-bit bytes. (Patch by
  Lukasz Stelmach.)
* Quotes are now placed around the "protocol" parameter in S/MIME headers
  in accordance to RFC 2045 (Marco Arioli, Jeffrey Stedfast).
* The conversion of messages in state-dependent encodings has been fixed;
  garbage characters could be inserted because the state was not properly
  reset when a buffer was enlarged (patch by Matthew Fischer).
* A warning about an initalization of an unsigned value to -1 has been
  eliminated (patch by Matthew Sienkiewicz).
* Percent characters in the "prompt" variable are now handled correctly;
  values of "folder" beginning with an at character and longer than the
  maximum system path length do not cause a heap overflow anymore (patch
  by Ulf Harnhammar).

[12.0] released 3/4/06
* The program has been integrated into the Heirloom project as "mailx". The
  new project homepage is at <http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/mailx.html>.
  The name "nail" will persist in some places, and the mailing list will
  remain with the same address for now. If you want to continue to call
  the program as "nail", create a symbolic link to "mailx".
* Mailx no longer prints a space before the address in "MAIL FROM:<xxx>" and
  "RCPT TO:<xxx>" in SMTP. This should make it work with Sendmail X (bugs
  reported by Stephane Lentz and Claus Assmann).
* The new "-S variable[=value]" command line option sets the internal option
  "variable", and, in case of a string option, assigns "value" to it (based
  on a request by Dmitry Butskoy).
* If the "smtp-auth-user" variable is set but neither "smtp-auth-password"
  nor a matching "smtp-auth-password-user@host" can be found, the user is
  asked for the SMTP AUTH password on the terminal (proposed by
  Svend Sorensen).
* When a TERM signal is sent to the SMTP transfer child process, it will
  abort and save the message to the "dead.letter" file (proposed by
  Perry Hutchison).
* Use of the "resend" command with multiple messages at once now works as
  documented (bug reported by Svend Sorensen).
* When the "next" or newline command is typed as the first command after a
  folder has been opened, the first (new) message is printed even if a
  folder hook has been executed previously (bugreport by Stephen Isard).
* In combination with OpenSSL, when a SIGPIPE was received on an SSL socket
  during a call to SSL_read() e.g. because an IMAP connection had timed out,
  a segmentation fault occurred because OpenSSL apparently cannot handle
  calls to SSL_shutdown() from the signal handler. This has been fixed (bug
  reported by Svend Sorensen).
* Building without socket support works again (Patch by Fernando J. Pereda).

[11.25] released 7/29/05
* The base64 encoder used an invalid encoding for the last unit of data if
  (bytes_of_input % 3 == 2); it wrote two encoded bits beyond the last byte
  then. Most base64 decoders, including nail's own, ignore such bits since
  base64 data is always a multiple of 8-bit bytes. This might explain why
  no harm caused by this error has been found for years. (Bug reported by
  Lukasz Iwaszkiewicz).
* When a completely cached IMAP message was copied on a server supporting
  the UIDPLUS IMAP extension and the message had not been printed during
  the current session yet, the cached entry for the target message contained
  the message body twice. This bug has been fixed, but cached messages
  written by previous nail versions may still suffer from this error. To get
  rid of them, delete them from the IMAP cache directory. The file README in
  that directory explains its structure.
* When sending messages, input data that lacks a terminating newline is now
  always encoded in quoted-printable.
* Wildcard host names in certificates according to RFC 2595 are now accepted
  (Bug reported by Svend Sorensen).
* The new "maximum-unencoded-line-length" variable allows to configure the
  limit on the line length that causes an ASCII text message to be sent in
  quoted-printable if exceeded (on request by Greg Cox).
* Since RFC 2595 allows wildcards at other places than RFC 2818 which is
  implemented by Mozilla NSS, host name verification is now done separately.
* The "sort xyz" commands now uncollapse all threads of a previously threaded
  folder view; messages in collapsed threads were previously not shown when
  the folder was sorted.
* The junk mail filter now also ignores the "X-pstn" header fields generated
  by "postini" filtering software.

[11.24] released 7/14/05
* When the 'replyto' variable was set, sending a message resulted in a
  segmentation fault due to a NULL pointer dereference (Bug reported by
  Nick Pasich).
* An 'imap-list-depth' variable was introduced to control the maximum depth
  of the folder traversal for the 'folders' command if the folder separator
  on the IMAP server is not the slash '/'.
* If standard output is not a terminal device, the output of the 'folders'
  command applied to an IMAP account is no longer arranged into columns.
* The new '-R' option causes all folders to be opened read-only.
* When the From address was changed with '~H', the value obtained from the
  'from' variable was still used for the SMTP transfer, for generating the
  Message-Id, and for S/MIME signing. This has been fixed; the changed
  address is now used throughout.
* When reading header fields from a terminal, the input buffer could
  overflow by one byte (Patch by Ulf Harnhammar).
* Only applicable if Mozilla NSS is used for SSL support: If the certificate
  of the server contains a dNSName, NSS ignores the CN. Thus if the CN
  contains a name that does not also appear as one of the dNSNames, the
  certificate is rejected. This case is now verified separately in nail,
  and the certificate is accepted if the CN matches the host name of the
  server.

[11.23] released 6/28/05
* The output for the '~p' tilde escape was extended to include the fields
  implied by the 'from', 'replyto', 'sender', and 'ORGANIZATION' variables
  (Proposed by Bob Tennent).
* The 'autocc' and 'autobcc' variables are now evaluated before composition
  of a message begins. The resulting addresses can thus be edited and viewed
  using the '~b', '~c', '~h', and '~p' tilde escapes, but changing the values
  of the 'autocc' and 'autobcc' variables using '~:set' has no effect on the
  currently composed message anymore.
* The values of the 'from' and 'replyto' variables can now contain multiple
  addresses.
* A 'sender' variable was introduced to set the content of the 'Sender:'
  field for outgoing messages.
* A '~H' tilde escape was introduced. It allows to set message-specific values
  for the 'From', 'Reply-To', 'Sender', and 'Organization' header fields.
  These fields are now also accepted in the editor output with the
  'editheaders' variable.
* The '-r' option now actually disables tilde escapes as documented (Bugreport
  by Bob Tennent).
* The INSTALL file now notes that sendmail must support the '-r' option if
  the '-r' option of nail is used (Issue reported by Attila Zimler and
  Allan Peda).
* The 'move' command does not anymore mark messages as moved if writing to
  an IMAP folder fails.
* The 'undelete' command now also clears the 'saved' flags of messages that
  have been moved.
* Fixed a crash due to a null pointer dereference that occurred when both
  control and non-ASCII bytes but no NUL bytes were present in a message
  body and no content type was defined in a mime.types file.
* The ~F and ~M tilde escapes did not work for interpolating messages with
  binary attachments anymore since version 11.13 (Bugreport by Tivon Luker).
* The current message is now shown in the header summary even if it has been
  killed.
* The 'kill' command did not operate correctly on 64-bit big-endian machines.
* A notification is now printed when text is saved to dead.letter.
* Changing %{prefix} in nail.spec works now for the RPM %install and %files
  step too (Patch by Allan Peda).

[11.22] released 3/20/05
* In threaded mode, the thread structure is now shown using line-drawing
  characters in the header summary. (This looks best on a UTF-8 terminal.)
* If a message contains both a 'References' and an 'In-Reply-To' header
  field, 'In-Reply-To' is now preferred for threading and the ',' address.
* When a message part of content-type text/anything is written with the
  pipe-type/subtype mechanism, it is now converted to the character encoding
  of the locale (as it was before 11.14 or so).
* When using a hostname with a port number attached with SMTP STARTTLS,
  strip the port number for correct host name verification (Bugreport by
  Gary E. Rafe).

[11.21] released 2/19/05
* When mail is sent using SMTP, 'Bcc:' fields are not passed to the
  server anymore (Bugreport by Matthew Fischer.)
* When replying to a message part for which a 'pipe-type/subtype'
  variable was set, quotes were inserted in the text sent to the pipe
  instead of in the output received from it (since v. 11.14 or so).
* A message that is already marked as answered is not marked again if
  it is replied to and the 'markanswered' variable is set.
* Nail no longer generates an error if renaming a message in a maildir
  folder fails because both the old and the new link have the same name
  (i.e. if the rename operation was superfluous).
* The new 'sendcharsets' variable was incorrectly named 'charsets' in
  nail.rc in the last version. If nail 11.20 was the first version of
  nail you ever installed, you should correct this by hand since the
  file is not overwritten by 'make install'. (Bugreport by Matthew
  Fischer.)
* Mozilla NSS error reports are more detailed now.
* For the 'touch', 'mbox', 'unread', and 'new' commands, a following 'next'
  command will advance to the next message as if the current one had been
  printed, as it has been the case with traditional mailx (Bugreport by
  Michael Sipser).
* Files in maildir folders are now read in the order obtained from
  readdir().
* When the variables 'sign' or 'Sign' are set to the empty string, they
  are treated as if they had been unset for the '~a' or '~A' commands.

[11.20] released 1/13/05
* A 'forward-as-attachment' variable has been introduced. If it is set,
  the 'forward' command uses a MIME 'message/rfc822' attachment for the
  original message instead of including it in the newly created text.
* The character set to be used for outgoing messages can now be specified
  with the 'sendcharsets' variable. It can contain multiple values, with
  the first appropriate one being used to send the message. The 'charset'
  variable is still accepted but has been removed from the documentation.
* If 'sendcharsets' contains more than one character set name, the '~@'
  tilde escape now asks about character sets for individual attachments
  if it is invoked without arguments.
* If neither the 'sendcharsets' nor the 'charset' variable is set, the
  character set for outgoing messages that contain non-ASCII characters is
  now 'utf-8' instead of 'iso-8859-1'.
* When the 'encoding' variable was set to '8bit' and a message contained
  characters that were not representable in the outgoing character set
  in its body but not in its header, the characters were replaced by
  question marks and the message was sent, instead of being rejected
  (Bugreport by Suresh Ramasubramanian).
* When sending messages in 8bit, conversions from a multibyte terminal
  character set failed because multibyte input characters where split
  across two conversion buffers if they spanned across buffer boundaries.
* A 'reply-in-same-charset' variable has been introduced. If it is set,
  nail tries to reply in the character set of the original message first.
* When the header of an outgoing message contained a non-ASCII character
  but the body did not, the name of the international character set was
  used for declaring the content-type of the body too. Us-ascii is now
  used for the body in such cases.
* When the 'fullnames' variable was set and the full name of a recipient
  was the only string in both header and body of an outgoing message that
  contained non-ASCII characters, no conversion between terminal character
  set and outgoing character set was performed for it.
* For files that contain ASCII control characters but no NULs, a 'charset'
  parameter was erroneusly generated even though these are not 'text/plain'
  according to MIME.
* Resolved a symbol conflict with SVR4 systems like Solaris that lead to
  failed builds because of a redeclaration of 'enum idtype'.
* When announcing messages after a folder open or a 'newmail' command, a
  deleted message can no longer become the current message unless all the
  messages have been deleted. This applies to message deleted by the
  'folder-hook' mechanism in particular.

[11.19] released 1/2/05
* A 'chained-junk-tokens' variable was introduced for the Bayesian junk
  mail filter. If set, the filter considers two-word tokens as described
  in Jonathan A. Zdziarski's paper 'Advanced Language Classification using
  Chained Tokens', <http://www.nuclearelephant.com/papers/chained.html>.
* When running in a UTF-8 locale, unprintable characters are now replaced
  by Unicode control pictures or the Unicode replacement character when
  printing to a terminal.
* The 'show' command now also avoids writing unprintable characters to a
  terminal. Same for the 'classify' command with the 'verbose' option set.
* Only MIME-encode words in header fields if they start with '=?' or end
  with '?=' (instead of encoding any words containing '?', '=', or '_'),
  and declare them as 'us-ascii' if they do not contain any bytes with the
  highest bit set (Bugreport by Suresh Ramasubramanian).
* Fixed a junk mail tokenizer bug which caused the remainder of a message
  to be ignored if a period occurred at the first position following another
  token boundary.
* 'In-Reply-To' fields that refer to multiple message-IDs are now handled;
  the first matching ID wins for the 'thread' command, and the ',' address
  selects all referenced messages.

[11.18] released 12/9/04
* When the 'write' command asks for an attachment filename and a '|' is
  given as the first character, the attachment is piped to the rest of
  the string interpreted as a shell command (contributed by Stephen Isard).
* The ~p escape now includes recipients that are local files in its output
  (Bugreport by Bob Tennent).
* The 'ungood' and 'unjunk' commands put the wrong marking on the messages
  they were applied too (regardless of the database update they performed).
  'Ungood' now marks a message as being junk, and 'unjunk' clears the junk
  mark.
* A 'record-resent' variable has been introduced. If it is set, the 'resend'
  and 'Resend' commands save messages to the 'record' folder. (Proposed by
  Bob Tennent.)
* 'redirect' and 'Redirect' are available as aliases for 'resend' and
  'Resend', respectively (proposed by Bob Tennent).
* A 'forward' command has been introduced that behaves more like the
  forwarding mechanisms of other contemporary mail user agents. Along with
  it, there are 'fwdignore', 'fwdretain', 'unfwdignore', and 'unfwdretain'
  commands, and a 'fwdheading' variable. The 'forward' command is probably
  only useful with a 'fwdretain' command executed before. Such a command is
  executed by default in /etc/nail.rc for new installations; for other sites,
  it is recommended that it be added manually.
* Characters with width 0 (e.g. Unicode combining characters) are now handled
  correctly in header summaries.
* When a message in a multibyte character set like UTF-8 that was encoded
  as quoted-printable was printed and a multibyte character was separated
  by a '=' continued line, it was not decoded correctly since release 11.14.

[11.17] released 11/18/04
* When the 'write' command was used to save attachments in releases after
  11.14, the output file was not properly closed. Since writes to that file
  are buffered, data was only completely written when nail was quit.

[11.16] released 11/18/04
* When a header field line that started and ended with a MIME encoded word
  followed a line that ended with a MIME encoded word, the newline character
  preceding the next header field was erroneously omitted when a message was
  displayed since version 11.14.
* If a header fields contains a MIME encoded word and a large string of
  ASCII characters at another point, the large string is encoded as multiple
  encoded words to comply to RFC 2047.
* The pipe-type/subtype mechanism did not work for MIME contents other than
  text/anything since release 11.14 (Bugreport by Bob Tennent).
* When S/MIME support was built using Mozilla NSS, the verification of an
  encrypted message that had not yet been downloaded from an IMAP or POP3
  server failed at the first attempt.
* Previous versions refused to write messages or attachments to /dev/null
  on some Solaris versions.
* If the 'from' variable is set to an address that does not contain an '@'
  character, no (syntactically incorrect) Message-ID is generated anymore.

[11.15] released 11/10/04
* The compilation process was fixed to work without CPPFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE on
  Linux/glibc again, although mremap() is not available then. It is therefore
  recommended to use CPPFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE with Linux/glibc. (Bugreports by
  Stephen Isard, Laurens Blankers, Bob Tennent.)
* The handling of interrupts during IMAP and POP3 operations has been revised
  as discussed on the mailing list. See the NOTES section in the manual page
  for a description.
* When an editor is invoked using ~e, ~v, 'edit', or 'visual', interrupts are
  no longer ignored in its process. With most editor implementations, this
  does not make any difference since they enable interrupts themselves again;
  however, traditional implementations of 'ed' do not.
* The 'forward' command has been renamed to 'resend' for alignment with the
  terminology of RFC 2822; it is still available under its old name for at
  least a transition period. Also, 'Resent-From:' and related fields are now
  prepended to older fields as specified.
* A 'seen' command has been introduced; it takes a message list and marks the
  messages as having been read.
* The semantics of the 'unjunk' command have been changed; it is now exactly
  the opposite of the 'junk' command and undoes its effects. An 'ungood'
  command has also been introduced to do the same for a previous 'good'
  command.
* Since many versions of Linux do not correctly update the modification time
  of a file with mmap(), utime() is now called to force an update when the
  junk mail database is changed.
* A mbox-style "From " line is now generated when a "message/rfc822" MIME
  part is printed.
* The 'multipart/digest' MIME content type is now properly handled.
* When a malformed MIME multipart message is encountered that contains the
  boundary string on two immediately following lines, the second line is no
  longer treated as the begin of a new part.
* The makeconfig script and the installation instructions now include support
  for building nail with Mozilla NSS on Solaris.
* Building IMAP GSSAPI authentication with Heimdal Kerberos libraries works
  again.

[11.14] released 11/4/04
* A 'Z' command was introduced. It is similar to the 'z' command, but scrolls
  only to header groups that contain at least one new or flagged message. This
  is useful for reading large mailing lists.
* The attachment decoding functions have been rewritten. As a result, nail is
  now able to decrypt and display encrypted parts of multipart messages.
* For MIME messages of type 'multipart/alternative', only the text/plain part
  is displayed now if one is present with the 'print'-like commands. The
  'print-alternatives' variable can be set to print all parts, as it was
  done previously. The 'Print'-like commands always print all parts.
* The ~F and ~M escapes now cause all parts of MIME multipart messages to be
  included in the message being composed.
* A 'show' command was introduced to make the raw MIME-encoded message text
  visible.
* Modifications to messages made using the 'edit' and 'visual' commands do
  no longer cause changes to the current folder. This is the behavior demanded
  by POSIX.1-2004. MIME decoding and decryption are now performed before each
  message is passed to the editor. If you prefer the old behavior, set the new
  'writebackedited' variable.
* When large amounts of messages were deleted on an IMAP server (or many
  other STORE commands were generated e.g. because many messages were marked
  as read), nail sent all of these commands asynchronously. This did slow
  down operation with some servers and eventually lead to a deadlock after
  some thousand commands were sent. Nail now waits for server responses in
  defined intervals. (Bugreport by Stephen Isard.)
* The handling of read-only compressed mbox format folders was fixed.
* In version 11.12, fcntl() read locking was erroneously introduced for files
  other than system mailboxes too. It is now disabled for such files again.
* If the junk mail database is stored in uncompressed format, mmap() is now
  used to access it if possible.
* Recipients that are file names are now removed from the Cc: and Bcc: fields
  of outgoing mail too, as it was already done for To:.
* If S/MIME support was built using OpenSSL and an encrypted message was tried
  to be decrypted without an appropriate private key, nail dumped core due to
  a NULL pointer dereference. It now fails sanely.

[11.13] released 10/27/04
* Backslashes outside a quoted command argument are now handled properly.
* For junk mail detection, the characters '_', '#', '&', and '%' are now
  considered as word constituents. Also the '/' character is kept if it
  occurs between digits, and the ';' character if a '&' was previously
  encountered within the same word.
* For junk mail detection, fields of MIME part headers are now handled like
  fields of the main header.
* For junk mail detection, most HTML tags are now ignored, similar to the
  proposal in Paul Graham's 'Better Bayesian Filtering'. Also, the top and
  bottom probabilities are now adjusted to the number of messages used for
  building the database.
* When the junk mail database is updated, it is now truncated beyond the
  last byte just written. Previously, stale data could have remained after
  this point, which was no problem for nail itself, but could make zcat(1)
  fail on the file.
* In the junk mail database, hashes of 56 bits are now used to represent
  words. A side-effect is that it is possible to test for occurences of
  given words with a higher certainty.
* To take advantage of the changes to the junk mail recognition method,
  you have to delete your junk mail database and have to create it again.
* The new 'probability' command prints the junk statistics for given words.
* The 'answered', 'classify, 'draft', 'flag', 'good', 'junk', 'undraft',
  'unflag', and 'unkill' command now make their argument the current
  message. This is now also done by the 'score' command unless the new
  score of the message is negative.
* Very old versions of OpenSSL are now detected by the configuration script.
  OpenSSL code will not be included if the version is too old (Bugreport by
  Thomas Voegtle).

[11.12] released 10/21/04
* Blank characters between MIME encoded words in header fields are now
  discarded for display purposes as demanded by RFC 2047.
* Unless the 'fullnames' variable was set, nail did not generate 'To' header
  fields when replying to messages since version 11.5 (Bugreport by Bob
  Tennent).
* An internal problem in the token scanning for junk mail detection has been
  fixed; the end of the mail header was not always correctly determined.
* Special characters in IMAP or POP3 account strings like 'imap://user@host'
  can now be escaped using URL notation, e.g. 'foo%2Fbar' for 'foo/bar'. It
  was previously not possible to use these characters. This is a slightly
  incompatible change as the '%' character must now also be escaped, as
  '%25'. (Bugreport by Thomas Wolff.)
* The system mailbox is now locked using fcntl(2) for reading too (Problem
  reported by Thomas Wolff).
* When new mail arrives in an IMAP mailbox, the current message is now
  properly advanced by the 'next' command if it has been printed before.
* If neither the host name nor the user's email address can be determined,
  no Message-ID fields are generated.
* The empty string is now accepted as a message subject for sending.

[11.11] released 10/13/04
* When sending messages that contain ASCII control characters but neither
  NULs nor non-ASCII characters, the quoted-printable MIME encoding is now
  used instead of 7bit.
* A dangling pointer after a memory reallocation could result in a coredump
  when the junk mail database was updated by a 'good' or a 'junk' command.
* The code for accessing the junk mail database has been made more machine-
  independent. It will not make a difference on most of the platforms on
  which nail runs. If your compiler does insert padding into C structs that
  contain only members of type char, you will have to create the junk mail
  database from scratch again, though.

[11.10] released 10/3/04
* The creation of quoted-printable encoded MIME data was broken in 11.9.
* Junk mail filter improvement: Do not ignore single-letter words; extract
  hostnames from URLs and store them separately.

[11.9] released 10/2/04
* A Bayesian junk mail filter has been added. See the 'EXAMPLES' section of
  the manual page for an introduction.
* Fixed an IMAP response parsing bug which caused nail to hang on messages
  that contained no text with many IMAP servers.
* Empty lines within the command lists for account or macro definitions are
  now ignored.
* An attempt to define a macro twice is now properly detected and results in
  an error message.
* Nail was reported to hang sporadically when sending multipart messages on
  HP-UX. A possible reason for such problems on systems without /dev/urandom
  has been eliminated (Bugreport by Patrick Briggs).
* Fixed a small internal stack buffer overflow that occured regardless of
  input data and lead to segmentation faults on some platforms when the
  header summary was printed, depending on the stack layout.
* Nail now builds without socket (networking) support again.
* Function declarations and definitions have been converted to ANSI C. This
  should cause no problems since the code used ANSI C features anyway before.

[11.8] released 9/23/04
* Support for S/MIME has been added. Introductory documentation is available
  in the 'EXAMPLES' section of the manual page.
* It is now possible to use Mozilla NSS instead of OpenSSL for both S/MIME
  and SSL/TLS. This makes it possible to use Mozilla to manage the certificate
  databases. See the INSTALL file for futher details. Note to redistributors:
  The new file nss.c is governed by the Mozilla Public License (MPL), so make
  sure that you comply to it (or delete that file and do not use NSS).
* Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) can now be used with S/MIME and SSL/TLS
  in combination with OpenSSL (for NSS, no special support is necessary).
* New 'remove' and 'rename' commands for mailboxes are available.
* Variable names that contain an '@' are now converted to all-lowercase
  internally. Thus in variable names like disconnected-user@host,
  imap-auth-user@host, password-user@host, smtp-auth-user@host, the case
  of the user@host part does not matter anymore.

[11.7] released 9/16/04
* A collapsed view of message threads was introduced. See the 'collapse'
  and 'uncollapse' commands, and the 'autocollapse' variable.
* The 'z' command now always shifts the header summary by a full screen
  of messages and is not disturbed by deleted, hidden, or killed messages
  anymore.
* When an 'account' command was executed and messages were sent to mbox
  when the old mailbox was quit, the mbox on the new account was used.
  Messages from the old mailbox now go to the mbox on the old account.
* Nail did not properly keep the mark for the current message if messages
  were expunged on an IMAP server.
* The 'move'/'Move' command now sets the current message to the first
  undeleted message following the last message it moved, like the 'delete'
  command.
* The 'markanswered' variable has been fixed to be effective with the
  'Reply' command too, and not to mark messages if the reply has been
  aborted by '~q' or '~x' or if a send error was detected.
* If the initial connection setup to an IMAP server is interrupted or if
  authentication fails, folder hooks are no longer executed.
* If the 'inc'/'newmail' commands were executed on an IMAP connection that
  was already closed by the server, nail did not catch SIGPIPE properly and
  was terminated.
* IMAP or POP3 servers that erroneously send a Unix 'From ' line at the
  beginning of message headers are now handled gracefully.

[11.6] released 9/7/04
* An IMAP performance improvement introduced in release 11.5 lead to an
  inconsistency in the internal states if a command like 'copy' was
  followed by another command that fetched a message text from the server.
  Due to an error in the IMAP response parser, this sometimes resulted in
  core dumps.
* Support for the 'maildir' folder format was added.
* The 'account' command was changed; its syntax and semantics are similar
  to the 'define' command now. This change is downwards compatible, and
  old 'account' definitions are still accepted.
* If the account listing generated by the 'account' commands without an
  argument exceeds the screen height, the pager is invoked now.
* It is not an error to 'unset' an undefined variable from within a 'call'
  command or folder hook now.
* A 'defines' command was added to print the currently defined macros.
* The header summary that is printed when new mail arrives erroneously
  included killed messages.
* When a message in a multibyte character set like UTF-8 that was encoded
  as quoted-printable was printed and a multibyte character was separated
  by a '=' continued line, it was not decoded correctly.
* The '&' addressing mode is now recognized in non-threaded mode too,
  although it has no special effect then.
* When the 'thread', 'sort', 'unthread', or 'unsort' commands are called
  from within a folder hook, they do not print a header summary anymore.
  Also, the first new message is made the current message correctly now
  in this situation.

[11.5] released 9/5/04
***************************************************************************
* A mailing list has been created to discuss future nail developments and *
* problem reports. If you like to participate, you can subscribe at       *
* <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/nail-devel>. Regardless   *
* of your subscriber state, bug reports etc. should be sent to the list   *
* address <nail-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> from now on.                 *
***************************************************************************
* A new message addressing mode '(criteria)' is now available. It uses the
  IMAP SEARCH command if possible, and otherwise performs the equivalent
  actions locally. This addressing mode is of interest even for those people
  who do not use IMAP with nail because it adds powerful generic search
  methods, such as a way to search within message bodies.
* The 'folders' command now really works with IMAP accounts. It also accepts
  an argument to list the subfolders of a specific folder.
* The new 'headline' variable allows to customize the columns in the header
  summary.
* The new 'attrlist' variable allows to customize the attributes column in
  the header summary.
* The message flags 'Flagged' (F), 'Answered' (A), and 'Draft' (T) are now
  available, for IMAP mailboxes as well as for local folders. See the 'flag',
  'unflag', 'answered', 'unanswered', 'draft', and 'undraft' commands and the
  'markanswered' variable.
* The 'kill'/'unkill'/'score' commands were added to make messages invisible
  on the user's wish.
* It is now possible to define sequences of commands as macros, see the
  'define', 'call', and 'undef' commands. Macros can also be automatically
  invoked when a folder is opened using the 'folder-hook' and
  'folder-hook-fullname' variables.
* The new 'move' and 'Move' commands mark messages for deletion when they
  have been successfully transferred to the target folder.
* The new addressing mode '`' selects all messages that were included in the
  message list to the previous command.
* The combination of the previous additions allows a score/filter file to be
  set up; this is described in the EXAMPLES section of the manual page.
* New 'noop' command to send NOOP to POP3 or IMAP servers.
* The IMAP UIDPLUS extension (RFC 2359) is now used if available on the
  server. It speeds up the IMAP cache when copying messages to IMAP folders;
  the message is copied directly to the cached target folder then and does
  not need to be downloaded again when it is accessed there.
* When an IMAP SELECT command fails and a connection to a folder that is
  not located on the same server is made afterwards, the connection to
  the old server is properly terminated now.
* Command lines like 'nail -A imap -f @mailbox' now work.
* IMAP or POP3 user names that contain an '@' character, such as 'foo@bar'
  in 'imap://foo@bar@hostname', are now handled (Bugreport by Lars
  Kellogg-Stedman).
* If the 'autoinc'/'newmail' variables are set and new mail arrives in
  threaded/sorted mode, no summary of old headers is printed anymore.
* If new mail arrives and messages are expunged on an IMAP server at the same
  time, all of the new messages are now announced correctly.
* The 'inc'/'newmail' commands now set the current message to the first new
  message again. This undoes the change made for version 11.1.
* When the 'autoinc'/'newmail' variables are set and new mail arrives, the
  'next' command or enter key prints the next message as usual if the current
  one has been printed; it printed the current message again in this situation.
* IMAP performance improvement: When new mail arrives, or when messages have
  been expunged, metadata is fetched only for the new messages, instead of
  fetching it for all messages in the folder again as it was done before.
* IMAP performance improvement: If the header of a message was already
  fetched from an IMAP server, nail now uses 'BODY.PEEK[TEXT]' when
  fetching the whole message and does not download it again.
* IMAP performance improvement: The CLOSE command is now used instead of
  EXPUNGE when a mailbox is quit.
* Cached IMAP performance improvement: When a mailbox is opened and messages
  are cached, their sizes and internal dates are taken from the cache.
* The wcwidth() library function is now used to determine the width of
  multibyte characters if it is available.
* If $MAIL does not exist and 'emptystart' is set, a proper error message
  is printed now, and a following 'account' command succeeds.
* The SSL code compiles with older versions of OpenSSL (e.g. 0.9.6b) again
  (Bugreport by Lutz Horn).

[11.4] released 8/29/04
* The SSL/X509 DNS name verification code was fixed; it used incorrect code
  from a book which sometimes caused segmentation faults (Bugreport by Lars
  Kellogg-Stedman).
* The 'disconnect' command now accepts an optional message list specifying
  messages to be read into the IMAP cache before the connection is closed.
* The new 'cache' command reads a list of messages into the IMAP cache.
* IMAP BODY.PEEK[] is now used when fetching messages from the server, and
  the '\Seen' flag is set when the 'quit' command is executed. Thus an
  'exit' command does not cause messages marked to be read.
* The 'connect'/'online' commands now announce new messages that are found
  on the server.
* The 'replyto' variable can now contain multiple addresses.
* If the 'sort' command is used without arguments, the current sorting
  criterion is printed.
* The 'sort', 'thread', 'unsort', and 'unthread' commands now only print a
  header summary if the 'header' variable is set.
* The 'size' command has been fixed to print the full sizes of messages that
  have not yet been entirely read in IMAP and POP3 folders, instead of the
  sizes of the already downloaded parts.
* Deleted messages remained in the cache until an IMAP folder was accessed
  a second time since 11.3. They are now deleted immediately when a folder
  is quit in online mode.
* The configuration system now also checks for iconv() in libiconv if it is
  not found in one of the standard libraries (Matthias Andree).
* Specifying LIBS on the make command line does now work with several make
  implementations of commercial Unices too (Bugreports by Matthias Andree,
  Matthew Sienkiewicz).

[11.3] released 8/18/04
* When an IMAP mailbox is opened in threaded/sorted mode and new messages
  arrive or old ones are deleted, the internal thread structure is now
  properly rebuilt. The previous failure to do so made nail dump core in
  most cases.
* The 'forward' command was fixed; it used an unitialized variable since
  release 11.2, possibly leading to segmentation faults (Bugreport by Bob
  Tennent).
* The behavior of the 'autoinc'/'newmail' variables regarding IMAP folders
  was changed. If both variables are unset, announcements are printed only
  if messages have been deleted on the server.
* The 'new'/'unread' commands now also work with IMAP folders.
* When a message is deleted or saved in disconnected mode, its cache entry
  is not removed until the message is actually removed from the server in
  online mode. This in particular means that saved or 'mbox'ed messages
  are still available in IMAP inboxes in disconnected mode until they have
  reached their target folder in online mode.
* When new messages were received in an IMAP mailbox after messages had
  been deleted in a previously visited IMAP mailbox, 'Expunged x messages'
  was erroneously printed.

[11.2] released 8/15/04
* A message thread-oriented mode is now optionally available; cf. the 'thread'
  and 'unthread' commands, the 'autothread' variable, and addressing changes.
* It is also possible to sort messages by various other criteria; cf. the
  'sort' and 'unsort' commands, the 'autosort' variable, and addressing
  changes.
* New 'fullnames' variable: When replying to a message, full names for the
  recipients are included if it is set, instead of using the plain email
  address.
* New commands 'disconnect' and 'connect'/'online' to switch to disconnected
  IMAP mode and back while retaining the current mailbox.
* IMAP GSSAPI authentication was implemented; it has been successfully
  compiled with MIT, Solaris, and HP-UX GSS libraries. See the 'imap-auth'
  and 'imap-auth-user@host' variables.
* CRAM-MD5 authentication was implemented for IMAP and SMTP. See the
  'imap-auth' and 'smtp-auth' variables.
* POP3 APOP authentication is now supported; see 'pop3-use-apop'.
* STARTTLS is now also supported for IMAP and POP3; see 'imap-use-starttls'
  and 'pop3-use-starttls'.
* Autodetection of the terminal character set works again (did not work since
  10.8).
* The 'showlast' variable works again; it had no effect since version 11.0.
* Made it compile using the HP-UX C compiler again (did not work since 11.0).
* Standard input is now redirected to /dev/null in the child process that
  contacts the MTA. A result is that ssl-verify=ask has the same effect as
  ssl-verify=strict for SMTP servers, and does not put the terminal in an
  indeterminable state anymore.
* The initial connection to IMAP or POP3 servers is now made before the
  previous mailbox (if any) is quit. Thus if a server is unreachable, nail
  keeps the previous mailbox open instead of getting in a mailbox-less
  state.
* Stale cache entries for messages deleted on the server were not removed
  in some circumstances.
* The 'inc'/'newmail' commands are now ignored in disconnected mode and no
  longer display errors about hidden (uncached) messages.
* The cache now compiles and works on systems that lack fchdir(), such as
  some Cray machines (Thanks to Cray-Cyber.org).
* The defaults for /etc/nail.rc have been updated. This will have no effect
  on existing installations unless the file is copied by hand.
* Nail does not hang anymore in disconnected mode if a message addressed
  with ^ or $ is not cached.

[11.1] released 8/8/04
* IMAP mailboxes can now be cached locally. See the string variable
  'imap-cache' in the manual page. The cache can also be used for
  disconnected operation mode, see 'disconnected' and also the '-D'
  command line option.
* When nail is notified by the server that messages have been expunged,
  the user is informed about this condition even if new messages have
  also arrived.
* When the group of variables for an 'account' command contains a variable
  prefixed by 'no...' and the related variable is not set, it is not an
  error to unset it.
* The 'headers' command has been made faster when operating on an IMAP
  mailbox by bundling IMAP requests.
* When a 'folder' command was executed to change from an uncompressed
  file to a compressed one, the latter was incorrectly detected as
  being read-only.
* Unless one of the 'autoinc' or 'newmail' variables is set, nail does
  not actively check for new messages in the current IMAP mailbox before
  each prompt. New messages may nevertheless be detected after any
  other IMAP command has been issued, so the effect is mostly that
  not every nail command causes an IMAP command to be sent. Also if
  'autoinc' or 'newmail' are set to the value "noimap", they are
  ignored for IMAP mailboxes but still effective for local folders.
* The 'inc' and 'newmail' commands now use the same method to determine
  the location of the current message as the 'folder' command does. That
  means if there has been new mail before that is still unread when newer
  mail arrives, the older messages are displayed first.
* Nail does not generate 'Sender:' fields anymore.
* If OpenSSL is not available, STARTTLS support is not built, and nail
  compiles again without OpenSSL.

[11.0] released 7/30/04
* IMAP support has been added. It should considered to be in beta state
  now, but should not have any disturbing effects on other code unless
  it is actually used. (So the version jump does not require vendors to
  continue to ship older releases.)
  To get started with IMAP, see the manual page for the 'account',
  'folder', and 'imap' commands, and for the 'folder' variable, as
  well as the EXAMPLES and NOTES sections.
* Support for SMTP AUTH LOGIN was added (contributed by John Fawcett).
* It is now possible to encrypt SMTP with SSL/TLS, using the STARTTLS
  method as well as with the SMTPS variant.
* New 'account' command to set groups of variables.
* Line and column limits (used e.g. for the header summary) are updated
  when the size of the terminal is changed (handling SIGWINCH).
* If saving an outgoing message to the folder given in the 'record'
  variable fails, the message is not sent but put in 'dead.letter'
  instead. This rarely happens with local record folders, but is of
  concern if 'record' refers to an IMAP mailbox.
* For addresses specified with the ~b, ~c, ~h, and ~t tilde escapes
  or by the 'editheaders' method, if a comma, parenthesis, angle bracket,
  or quoting character appears, only the comma is accepted as an address
  separator. Otherwise, whitespace separates addresses as elsewhere. This
  allows the insertion of comments in recipient addresses and more closely
  matches the behavior of System V mailx. (Thanks to Ryan Lovett and Hilko
  Bengen.)
* An internal version of getopt() is now used to properly work around
  system defects such as the option reordering on GNU libc based
  systems. If you really prefer the libc version, remove getopt.o from
  the list of objects in the Makefile. (Note that nail already worked
  around the glibc problem, so unless _your_ patches changed its
  behavior, use the new internal getopt() to remain compatible.)
* The undocumented facility to pass sendmail options on the command
  line of nail has been removed because it was not compatible with
  POSIX and System V. If you need to pass options to sendmail, create
  a shell script which invokes it appropriately and let the nail
  variable 'sendmail' point to its location.
* Fixed the text of some usage messages (thanks to Christian Reiber).

[10.8] released 6/28/04
* Support for IPv6 is not built by default anymore. There are just too
  many hosts on which it doesn't work while the IPv4 functions work
  fine. If you have use for IPv6 support and know that it works, enable
  it in the Makefile.
* autoconf and automake are no longer used for building. See the file
  'INSTALL' which describes the transition of existing build setups.
* The --enable-all-chars configuration option is no longer available. A
  run-time nail option variable 'print-all-chars' has been introduced
  instead.
* Nail can now handle folders in compressed mbox format. If a file name
  given on the command line or with the 'folder', 'copy', and 'save'
  commands ends with '.gz' or '.bz2', gzip(1) or bzip2(1) are executed
  when reading and writing to it. Likewise, if a folder 'name' does not
  exist, but either 'name.gz' or 'name.bz2' are found, the compressed
  folder is used. To make use of compressed folders, just compress the
  respective mbox format file.
* If the variable SHELL is not set, the default shell is now /bin/sh
  instead of csh.
* If the variable EDITOR is not set, the default editor is now 'ed', as
  specified by SUSv3.
* Introduced an 'ssl-verify-user@host' variable as an account-specific
  variant of 'ssl-verify'.
* Introduced an 'ssl-method-user@host' variable as an account-specific
  variant of 'ssl-method'.

[10.7] released 3/19/04
* The IEEE and The Open Group have granted permission to use parts of
  the POSIX standard text for the documentation of 'nail'. See the
  file 'COPYING' for general terms. The manual page has been updated
  accordingly.
* If the variable 'sendwait' is set and the mail transfer agent returns
  a non-zero exit status, the exit status of nail will also be non-zero
  (Christian Reiber).
* For the first (textual) part of a multipart message, create a
  'Content-Disposition: inline' header field to make it clear to other
  MUAs that this part should be displayed directly (suggested by
  Alexandros Gougousoudis).
* Base64 encoded messages were not decoded correctly on machines where
  the 'char' type is unsigned by default (Fix by Benjamin C. W. Sittler,
  reported by Hilko Bengen).
* Any address that contains a '@' character is treated as an internet
  mail address (even if it contains a '/' character before).
* Fixed the 'autocc' and 'autobcc' variables to really accept address
  lists instead of single names.
* If a message is sent to both addressed recipients and local folders,
  don't pass the file names with the SMTP client.
* The ~w command appends the message text to an existing file instead
  of refusing to write, as POSIX.2 states (Bugreport by Bob Tennent).
* Escape sequences in quoted arguments to the alias, unset, chdir, cd,
  source, set, group, ungroup, unalias, file, folder, if, else, endif,
  alternates, ignore, discard, retain, saveignore, savediscard, saveretain,
  unignore, unretain, unsaveignore, unsaveretain, shortcut, and unshortcut
  commands are no longer handled specially. This is for compatibility with
  System V mailx and POSIX standards.
* The echo command accepts the same escape sequences as specified for
  echo(1) in recent Open Group standards.
* Only the \t and \n sequences are handled for the ~a, ~A and ~i tilde
  commands and the insertion of the MAILX_HEAD and MAILX_TAIL strings
  (Thanks to Bob Tennent).
* Solaris: When the MAILX_TAIL variable was set and a ~p command was
  issued before the message was sent, parts of the text were sent twice.
* Introduced a 'hostname' variable to override the value obtained from
  uname(2) and getaddrinfo(3) (William Bader).

[10.6] released 11/15/03
* A nested MIME multipart message with a sub-part piped through an external
  program (such as HTML with w3m) caused nail to abort after SIGPIPE if the
  PAGER command terminated before reading the whole message.
* A 'next' command following a 'hold' command displays the next message
  after the one the 'hold' applies to (Bugreport by Mike Sipser). This 
  might not be exactly what POSIX specifies, but it makes sense and is
  consistent with traditional behavior. If you actually favor 'next'
  not to advance after 'hold', contact me and I'll add a configuration
  option for this.
* If the value of the 'record' variable started with an environment
  variable reference such as '$HOME' or with a tilde and the 'outfolder'
  variable was set, it was not expanded correctly (Bugreport by Volker
  Kuhlmann).

[10.5] released 4/27/03
* A command line argument specifying a To-address can contain multiple
  recipients separated by commas (Werner Fink).
* 'showname' variable (based on code contributed by Stephen Isard).
* Display nonprintable characters in mail addresses as question marks.
* Fixed MIME encoding of user's From address with respect to quoted
  characters.
* 'autobcc' and 'autocc' variables.
* The effects of the 'bsdcompat' variable are now individually configurable.
  This introduces the 'bsdflags', 'bsdheadline', 'bsdset', 'bsdannounce',
  'askatend', 'bsdorder', and 'bsdmsgs' variables.
* The current message pointer could be garbled when 'newmail' was set and
  new messages appeared (Fix by Stephen Isard).

[10.4] released 1/19/03
* A missing #ifdef HAVE_ICONV caused build errors on platforms without
  iconv() support (J.A. Neitzel, Jens Schleusener, Lars Kellogg-Stedman,
  Felicia Neff, Chris Pinnock).
* Extraction of parts from header fields with more than 2560 characters
  fixed (Lukasz Sznuk, William Cherry).
* Source archive name in nail.spec corrected (Didar Hussain).
* Fixed segmentation violation when encountering multipart header fields
  that contain no ':' character (William Cherry).
* Respect the 'allnet' variable when comparing strings in message lists.
* IPv6 support (Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino).

[10.3] released 11/29/02
* Fixed a buffer overflow that occured with iconv() support disabled (Stan
  Tobias).
* MIME encoding of '(non-ASCII-string' comment strings in address fields
  fixed (non-ASCII-string immediately following the opening parenthesis).
* Convert header fields to outgoing character set even if the body contains
  ASCII characters only.
* Build properly on platforms without socket support (J.A. Neitzel).
* Don't require towupper() with mbtowc() (J.A. Neitzel). Searches for
  wide characters in subject fields are not case-insensitive without
  towupper().
* Some OpenBSD and NetBSD versions don't adjust the kernel file offset
  properly after a 'fflush(); rewind()' sequence, violating POSIX.1.
  This caused empty mails to be sent if the 'record' variable was set.
  The code now works around the problem (Thanks to J.A. Neitzel).
* NetBSD lacks gethostent(), causing the configure check for socket
  support to fail. gethostbyname() is now used instead (Thanks to J.A.
  Neitzel).

[10.2] released 11/23/02
* Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that occured if the 'showto' variable
  was used without the 'alternates' command (Bugreport by Bob Tennent).
* POP3 client with SSL/TLS support. See the description of the 'folder'
  command, the 'EXAMPLES' and 'NOTES' sections in the manual page, and
  the description of the new variables 'password-user@host,
  'pop3-keepalive', 'ssl-no-default-ca', 'ssl-v2-allow', 'ssl-verify',
  'ssl-ca-dir', 'ssl-ca-file', 'ssl-cert', 'ssl-cert-user@host',
  'ssl-key', 'ssl-key-user@host', 'ssl-method', 'ssl-cipher-list'
  'ssl-rand-egd', 'ssl-rand-file'. You need to execute './configure
  --with-openssl' to compile with SSL support.
* Respect assignments to the MAIL variable in startup scripts.
* Secondary mailboxes with %:folder (see the 'folder' command).
* 'shortcut' and 'unshortcut' commands.
* NAIL_EXTRA_RC variable.
* ',' address (matches the parent of the current message).
* ';' address (matches the message that was previously the current message).
* Recognize MIME in header field searches with '/'.
* The 'save' and 'copy' commands use the mbox file if invoked without
  an argument.
* Use wordexp() to expand special characters in filenames if available.
  $SHELL-specific metacharacters are thus no longer recognized.
* The output of the 'from' command is piped through the pager if it exceeds
  the screen height.
* 'datefield' variable.
* 'editheaders' variable (contributed by Stephen Isard).
* '-t' command line option.
* 'term' condition for 'if' command (contributed by Stephen Isard).
* Don't prepend a message with a blank line when saving if a blank line 
  is already present at the end of the file.
* Fixed quoting for command argument of 'pipe' (Stephen Isard).
* 'save' and 'copy' commands accept quoted file names with embedded whitespace.
* Allow '|shell-cmd' (Stephen Isard).
* 'piperaw' variable (Stephen Isard).
* If 'askcc' or 'askbcc' are set and 'bsdcompat' is not set, the user is
  asked for additional recipients before composing the message starts.
* Don't append an additional newline to filenames in recipient lists.
* Message lines starting with '>' were truncated by the 'forward' command.
* Don't rename old Resent-xxx fields when creating new ones.
* Deletion of attachments with '~@' fixed.
* Don't mark the saved copy of an unread message as read.
* Fixed use of a char variable for getc() (Arthur Korn).

[10.1] released 10/14/02
* POSIX.2 leaves the characters following 'From ' unspecified, so the
  presence of sender or date strings is no longer required to separate
  messages in a folder.
* 'inc' and 'newmail' commands, 'autoinc' and 'newmail' variables.
* Don't use iconv() if a message contains us-ascii characters only
  (Problem reported by Thomas Fieseler).
* Don't report 'Held n messages in mailfile' if n == 0.
* Don't report a 'Fatal error in process' with '!' unless bsdcompat is set.
* Missing fflush() caused empty mails with some GNU libc versions to be
  sent, unless SMTP was used (Problem reported by Thomas Fieseler).

[10.0] released 9/29/02
* Base64 decoding was calling malloc(0) which caused "Out of memory"
  errors on some platforms (Bugreport by Stan Tobias).
* Install nail.rc in the place specified with --with-rcfile (Bugreport by
  Jeffrey Neitzel)
* Code cleanup in send.c (Contribution by Stan Tobias).
* When writing attachment data, the 'w' command will no longer append to
  a file, but truncate and overwrite it.
* Extract filenames from obsolete 'Content-Type: ...; name=file' fields (Stan
  Tobias).
* Delete directory components from attachment filenames before saving (Fix by
  Stan Tobias).
* NAILRC variable (based on a suggestion by Stan Tobias).
* "bsdcompat" and "prompt" variables; prompt defaults to "? ".
* "allnet", "debug", "flipr", "outfolder", "sendwait", and "showto" variables
* "bang" variable. NOTE: Previous versions behaved as if this variable
   had been set.
* ~a and ~A tilde escapes with standard semantics.
* -F command line option, "Mail", "followup", "Followup", "Copy" and "Save"
  commands.
  NOTE: This changes the abbreviation of the "folder" command to "fold".
* "set nofoo" unsets the variable "foo". The variables "nosave" and "noheader"
  have therefore changed in their positive counterparts and are now set by
  default.
* The pg command is now the default pager unless bsdcompat is set.
* Line and character counts are printed for copy and save commands.
* MAILX_HEAD and MAILX_TAIL variables.
* LC_MESSAGES support.
* -I option prints 'Newsgroups:' field in header summary now. NOTE: The
  functionality of the old -I option, "interactive", is no longer available
  as an option. Use something like "env interactive= nail ..." instead. If
  only tilde escapes in send mode are needed, the new -~ option can be used.
* The optional name argument in combination with the -f option is now
  evaluated as a separate operand, not as an argument to -f. This enables
  usage as "nail -fin name", but "nail -f name -in" is no longer valid.
* Pipe the output of ~p through the PAGER if the text is long (Bugreport
  by Stan Tobias).
* The output format of the "set" command is changed to 'variable="value"'
  if bsdcompat is not set.
* Pipe the output of the "set" command through the PAGER if it is long.
* Headers are not printed automatically after executing a "folder" command
  if bsdcompat is not set.
* The "next" command was fixed according to the remark in the POSIX
  rationale not to skip a message e. g. after "delete".
* -B, -h and -~ command line options.
* Lines in message files can now be of arbitrary length and can contain
  NUL characters.
* -r disables tilde escapes; -r flag and address is passed to sendmail.
* followupall, followupsender, replyall, replysender, respondall, and
  respondsender commands.
* New, new, and Unread commands (are all aliases to unread command).
* unalias command implemented (had been documented since 4.4BSD).
* unignore, unretain, unsaveignore, and unsaveretain commands.
* If data from standard input contains NUL characters, no character
  conversions are performed and it is sent in base64 encoding.
* Non-binary data with long lines is sent in quoted-printable encoding.
* Fixed segmentation violation when using the "folder" command after
  an interrupt signal was catched.
* Resent-Reply-To: header field is no longer generated for conformance
  with RFC 2822.
* Fixed -u user option and %user special file name not to ignore 'user'.
* The 'Reply' command uses the 'Reply-To:' header field in favor of
  'From:'; the 'reply' command adds recipients given in the 'To:' and
  'Cc:' fields if a 'Reply-To:' field was present in the message. This
  means that 'Reply-To:' just overrides 'From:' without a special effect
  on the 'reply' and 'Reply' commands.
* When grabbing headers e. g. with the '~h' command, a comma is printed
  between names if bsdcompat is not set.
* RPM spec file (contributed by Didar Hussain).

[9.31] released 6/18/02
* New editing mechanism for attachment list: ~@ tilde escape.
* The ~a tilde escape is obsoleted by ~@ and has been removed.
* Header fields starting with =? are only interpreted as RFC 2047 fields
  if they are entirely valid (Bugreport by Russell Kroll).
* Sender addresses in message lists (as in 'delete from@host') match only
  the exact from address.
* Added ~x tilde escape (abort message composition without saving dead.letter).
* Fixed recognition of RFC 2045 parameter attributes (Bugreport by Russell
  Kroll).
* The "for" command now inserts an intact "Resent-Reply-To:" header field.
